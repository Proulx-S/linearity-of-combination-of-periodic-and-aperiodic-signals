# On the linearity of spectral power estimates of multiple signals
Numerical simulations demonstrating how periodic and aperiodic signals linearly combined in time-domain combine in frequency domain.

## Instructions
See doIt.html for a render of the doIt.mlx matlab live script that contains the main text and simulations.

The doIt.m matlab script is an older draft version.
